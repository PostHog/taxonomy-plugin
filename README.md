# Taxonomy Plugin

Standardize your event names into a single pattern by converting all event names that don't match the pattern to the selected pattern.

The plugin can convert from any of these to all the others:

* Camel Case: `helloThereWorld`
* Pascal Case: `HelloThereWorld`
* Snake Case: `hello_there_world`
* Kebab Case: `hello-there-world`
* Spaces: `hello there world`
